## Long-Term Vision

Make RegiLattice the **reference Windows registry tweak toolkit**:

- Zero-dependency runtime (stdlib-only at runtime)
- Production-grade packaging distributed via pip, winget, and scoop
- GUI that rivals dedicated system administration tools
- Full corporate-environment safety and detection
- Extensible plugin marketplace with sandboxing
- World-class CI/CD pipeline with cross-platform testing
- Comprehensive documentation and developer experience
